Java Programming 

------

### Project 1 | Basic IO 
    create a short and simple design tool and program that asks the user for three numbers. The output will be the sum and average of the three numbers.

### Project 3 | Beer Assignment 
    a program to determine the following:

    - How many beers will the user consume over the course of the year?
    - Assuming a beer is 150 calories, how many calories will the user take in from beer alone over the course of the year?
    - How much weight can the user expect to gain in one year based on the number of 12-ounce beers they consume every day?
    - How much the user will spend on beer this year?
    

### Project 4 | Methods IO & Exceptions 

    a menu driven program.  The menu will be responded to using a switch statement.  The menu options (cases) will be as follows (You should give them more succinct labels in your program):

        Read the user’s first name and echo it back out 20 times.
        Read the user’s age and double it and display the age and the doubled age.
        Read the user's age and output one of the following statements:
            Since you are xx years old, you are a teenager
            Since you are xx years old, you are NOT a teenager   (***of course xx displays the user's age)
        Read a single integer between 3 and 50 from the user. Create a triangle of X’s with the as many rows as the value of the user's input.  The triangle needs to be displayed on the screen and in a text document named triangle.txt.


### Project 5 | 1D Array 

     a program that does the following:

        Create an array of 100 integers.
        Store 100 random integers (between 1 and 100) in the array.
        Print out the elements of the array.
        Sort the array in ascending order.
        Print out the sorted array.
        Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 100. Search the array for that number and then display  "Found" or "Not Found" message.
        Display each number from 1 to 100 and the number of times each is found in the array.
        Display the average of the numbers in the array.
        Display the highest number in the array.
        Display the lowest number in the array.


### Project 6 | 2D Jagged Array

     a program that does the following:
        1. Uses a menu system
        2. Creates an array with 25 rows and an unknow number of columns
        3. You can assume that the row index represents one individual student
        4. Each column represents an exam score for that individual student (the number of exams will
        vary by student)
        5. Enter at least 10 students along with a varying number of exam scores for each different
        student.
        6. Display the Average for all exams by each Student Id
        7. Display the Average for each exam by Exam Number
        8. Display the class average

### Project 7 | Inheritance and OOP

    Utilize inheritance in a Java program and apply the IS A and HAS A relationships

### Project 8 | Second Inheritance 

    Create UMLs for all classes.
    WRITE JAVA code to create the classes from above.  In the classes you are creating you will include at least three fields or attributes (See sample alarm clock above).
    Add overloaded methods, and overridden methods.  Label each.  Create a Test class that creates at least 3 objects of each class.
    The parent and child classes need to have all necessary and required methods.

### Project 9 | Abstract Class
    use both concrete and abstract methods in an abstract class
    
        Theme: Cafe Drinks Abstract parent class: Drink Sub-class: Tea, Coffee, Boba 
        Test Class: Barista 
        Abstract method: Ratio (each drink sub-category has its own ratio of ingredients) 

### Project 10 | Java Interface 

    Create 3 Interfaces with Abstract Methods, a class that uses all three interfaces and implements their methods and a test class.
    Create all necessary setters, getters, constructors and methods.

    Cafe Drinks Interfaces: Content (sugar content; abstract class sugarContent), Time (brewing time = heat needed * number of items; abstract class heatTimeNeeded), Straw (boolean; abstract class needsStraw). All sub-classes implement all interfaces. 
    Abstract parent class: Drink Sub-class: Tea, Coffee, Boba 
    Test Class: Barista 
    Abstract method: Ratio (each drink sub-category has its own ratio of ingredients) 

### Project 11 | First Poly 

    Polymorphism
